	<h1>Dungeons and Dragons</h1>
	<p>The API I selected was a Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition game encyclopedia, filled with descriptive information about
		various spells, classes, and monsters found in the fictional universe. To use the API, give a request with a subsection
		of the game (like a spell) and then specify the name of the thing you want information of from the subsection. The example
		they give is the spell Acid Arrow.<p>
	<p>The website I found the API in is http://www.dnd5eapi.co/, which I also got from the public list of APIs from the AJAX
		reading, found here: https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis.<p>
	<p>As there was no CORS or HTTPS or key necessary for this simple API, the options I used were standard. I simply just specified
		the name of the thing I wanted from the game and the API returns it in JSON format.</p>
	<p>Two applications that this API could be used for:</p>
	<p>1)Resource for Dungeons and Dragons players, both experienced and not, who need to look something up from the game.</p>
	<p>2)Due to the creative nature of the game, people who like writing could potentially read the descriptions of things
		from the game to get inspired</p>
